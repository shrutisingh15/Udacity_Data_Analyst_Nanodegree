# Udacity_Data_Analyst_Nanodegree

This repository contains my course work from Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

Project P1 : Test a Perpetual Phenomenon -- This project uses descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyse Stroop Effect, a classic result of experimental psychology.

Project P2 : Investigate a Dataset -- This project is all about investigation of dataset from Lahman's baseball Database using Numpy and Pandas library.It contains the entire data analysis process right from posing a question to sharing the findings.

Project P3 : Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data using SQL -- This project work contains data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for Syracuse City.The cleaned data has been written to csv files and these csv files are imported to SQL Database.Further exploration is performed through SQL queries.

Project P5 : Identify fraud from Enron Email -- This project focusses on machine learning in which techniques of supervised & unsupervised classification, regression, and validation have been used.In the final project, I have modeled an ExtraTreesClassifier (supervised machine learning) to identify persons of interest from financial and email data of Enron Corpus. Used StratifiedShuffleSplit method from sklearn to perform train-test split. Tuned the model using GridSearchCV to improve recall and precision scores by 24%. Performed K-Means Clustering to figure out who in the organization was on the board of directors & who was just a regular employee. Studied the correlation between salaries and bonuses of the employees using Linear Regression.
